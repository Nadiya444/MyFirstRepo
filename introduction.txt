Brief Introduction About Myself.

My name is Nadiya, and I’m a Software Engineering student at ALCHE. I’m passionate about building technology that creates real world impact especially for people and communities often left out of the conversation.

Right now, I’m working on LearnPod, a learning app designed to support blind and deaf students. This project reflects what I care most about: making education more accessible, inclusive, and empowering for everyone.

My journey into tech didn’t start with a perfect answer it started with curiosity, persistence, and the belief that I could learn. I’ve also gained hands-on experience in mechanical and electrical engineering, which shaped how I approach problem-solving today.

I care deeply about advocating for girls in STEM, and I want to help shift the narrative by showing what’s possible when we're given access, encouragement, and opportunity.

I’m still learning. I’m still growing. And I’m always open to collaboration, mentorship, or just meaningful conversations with people who care about tech for good.

Let’s build something better together.
