My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year

Build and launch a fully functional web or mobile app:
Apply what I’m learning in software engineering to create a real world product, possibly an improved version of LearnPod.

Secure a tech internship or mentorship opportunity:
Gain hands on industry experience, grow my skills, and learn directly from professionals in software engineering and accessibility-focused tech.

Strengthen my programming skills:
 Master Python, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, and begin learning a backend language like Node.js or Django.

Contribute to an open-source project:
Collaborate with global developers and give back to the tech community by contributing to inclusive or educational tech tools.

Advocate for girls in STEM:
Host or speak at at least one event, workshop, or online platform that encourages girls (especially in underserved communities) to pursue tech.

Develop a strong LinkedIn and GitHub presence:
Share my journey weekly, connect with professionals, and build a portfolio that reflects who I am and what I’m passionate about.

Prioritize wellbeing and discipline:
Balance my tech growth with selfcare, consistency, and time for reflection so I stay focused, healthy, and motivated.
